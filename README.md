## Development Process

1. We discussed the project theme within the team and ultimately decided to create an e-commerce website.
2. We drew the website wireframe and defined user stories.
3. We created the data model based on the wireframe, user stories, and data flow.
4. We reported our project plan, wireframe, and data model to the instructor, and made modifications and adjustments based on the instructor's suggestions.
5. We set up the project infrastructure, including the frontend with React, the backend with Express, the database with MongoDB, and Node.
6. We assigned different pages of the website to various team members.
7. Team members aligned their project progress, troubleshot issues, pushed their branches to GitHub, resolved branch conflicts, and merged branches daily.
8. We reported the soft launch to the instructor and received feedback.
9. We made adjustments based on the instructor's feedback, mainly focusing on security and validation.
10. We gave a final presentation of our project to the instructor and classmates, and answered questions.

## Experience Summary

#### zeanchook

Wokring as a team in a project is definitely rewarding experience. We came accross many obstacles and problems, but in a team we navigate through all these chanllenges through effectively communicate and collborations. We overcame individual challenges and shared knowledge when we're facing dificulties. This effort not only accelerate our project development but also broadened our underrstanding towards the apporach we're taking. This expreince has equiped me with the importance of planning and communication.

#### Wai-Leng

Learning to work in a team as a software developer was both challenging and rewarding. Issues with Git Workflow were expected - this was a good learning experience on learning how to use git to facilitate development, and how conflicts can arise from multiple team members committing.

The other key challenge was learning to communicate as a team, from scoping out the project to communicating when to commit, when to work on additional features and when to focus on the core project.

However, the benefits of working in a team far outweighed the difficulties faced. Having team members to help troubleshoot areas I was having issues with was beneficial, in addition to expanding my perspectives and takeaways from the course material. Being able to draw on different experiences definitely helped with speeding up and enhancing development.

I also gained a greater appreciation for the details that go into making a website functional and secure. Basic small functions that tend to be taken for granted, like adding items to cart and adjusting quantities for an ecommerce website, can require a lot of thought in implementation. This will likely help with planning in future projects.

I also learned a lot about how to design APIs and Endpoints to perform CRUD operations and secure a website with multiple users via authentication and proper routing.



## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the community from the Shopify Developer's Discord, who patiently helped me with getting started on the Shopify app node template and explaining how to work with it. To my GA instructor Simon, who supported me in developing this app and provided guidance through the course. And of course, to my classmates in GA who played a part in my learning and helped when I was stuck, either with practical or moral support.
